## Introduction.

This is a project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer

responsive and accessible to users for all type of devices.
App should also be able to work when network connection
is down or poor.

## App Description.

info for the restaurant such as address, cuisine, oppening hours,
other user reviews and ratings.

2. Go into the repository folder and switch comments in code of

	1. js/dbhelper.js
	2. index.html
	3. restaurant.html

files in order to be able to run app in local server. The code
was modified in order to run the app in GitHub pages.

3. Project needs a local server to run.
	1. Open a bash command line window in the repository folder.
	2. Check if python is installed in your computer by typing `python -V` or `py -V`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
	3. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `py -m http.server 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

4. When you have a server up and running, open your browser and
visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
